Kong
Kong is an open-source API gateway and microservices management layer. It provides features such as load balancing, authentication, rate limiting, and request/response transformations. In your workspace, Kong is configured in the docker-compose.yml file and uses the declarative configuration file kong.yml.

The kong.yml file defines:

Certificates: SSL certificates for secure communication.
Services: Backend services like tracking, django, and grafana, each with defined routes for API paths.
Routes: Paths and methods for accessing the services.
Plugins: (Commented out) Optional plugins for request transformation.
Kong is set up to run in a container using the armeldemarsac/kong-oidc:4.0.0 image, with OIDC (OpenID Connect) support enabled.

Logging with Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana-Agent
Your workspace includes a logging stack for monitoring and observability, consisting of Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana-Agent.

1. Prometheus
Prometheus is a monitoring system that collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals. The configuration is in prometheus.yml:

Scrape Configurations: Defines targets like order-service-django and tracking-service-node to collect metrics from services running on specific ports.
2. Loki
Loki is a log aggregation system designed for storing and querying logs. Its configuration is in loki-config.yaml:

Storage: Uses a filesystem-based object store for logs.
Schema: Configured for indexing and chunk storage.
Server: Runs on port 3100 for receiving log data.
Retention: No retention policy is currently enforced.
3. Grafana-Agent
Grafana-Agent is a lightweight tool for collecting metrics and logs. Its configuration is in agent.yaml:

Metrics: Scrapes metrics from services like order-service-django and tracking-service.
Logs: Collects container logs from Docker and pushes them to Loki.
Pipeline Stages: Includes a docker stage for parsing Docker logs.
Integration
Metrics: Prometheus scrapes metrics, and Grafana-Agent forwards them to Prometheus.
Logs: Grafana-Agent collects logs and sends them to Loki.
Visualization: Grafana (not explicitly configured here) can be used to visualize metrics and logs from Prometheus and Loki.
This setup provides a comprehensive monitoring and logging solution for your services.
